##  Dataset

* Source: *(Mention source – Kaggle / company dataset / sample data)*
* Format: CSV / Excel
* Description:
  The dataset contains structured data related to *(sales / customers / products / reviews — update as per your project)* and is used to analyze trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* **SQL** (PostgreSQL / MySQL)
* **Power BI** (Dashboard & Visualization)
* **Gamma** (PPT creation)
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **MS Excel** (optional – initial review)

---

## Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Imported dataset into Python using Pandas.
   * Verified structure, datatypes, and missing values.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Analyzed data distribution and trends.
   * Identified outliers and anomalies.
   * Used visualizations for better understanding.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handled missing values.
   * Removed duplicates.
   * Corrected data types and inconsistencies.

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Loaded cleaned data into PostgreSQL / MySQL.
   * Wrote SQL queries using:

     * `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`
     * `JOINS`
     * Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`)
   * Extracted insights for reporting.

5. **Power BI Dashboard**

   * Built interactive dashboards.
   * Added filters, KPIs, and charts.
   * Designed for business users and decision-making.

6. **Reporting & Presentation**

   * Created a structured analysis report.
   * Designed a professional PPT using **Gamma** for storytelling and insights presentation.

##  Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights:

* Key performance indicators (KPIs)
* Trends and patterns
* Category-wise and time-based analysis
* Interactive filters for deeper insights

## Results & Insights

* Identified key trends and patterns in the data.
* Highlighted performance gaps and improvement areas.
* Converted raw data into actionable business insights.
* Delivered insights through clear visual storytelling.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Import cleaned data into PostgreSQL/MySQL and execute SQL scripts.
5. Open the Power BI file (`.pbix`) to view the dashboard.
6. Review the final report and PPT for insights summary.
